author: Jintong Hou, Ifeanyi Osuchukwu, Samuel Yoon
abstract: Diabetes increases the risk ofÂ heart disease by about four times in women but only about two times in men.
  This Risk Assessment interface is designed for physicians to enter individual patient records 
  and predict Diabetes Mellitus risk for women using logistic regression based on up-to-date data. 
  Female patients can assess their own diabetes risk by simply inputting their own information into our interface. 
  This tool can potentially provide better health outcomes for patients, by effecting earlier mitigating strategies 
  as it pertains to the onset of Diabetes Mellitus Ideally a physician utilizing this interface will be able to 
  store new patient records into a database and also have the ability to search, update, and delete records 
  as they deem necessary.
